# Autogenerated Ruby Clients
This repo contains API clients for the Gusto Embedded and App Inegrations APIs.

# Getting started
If you are new to the Gusto Embedded API, see our getting started guide [here](https://docs.gusto.com/embedded-payroll/docs/getting-started). Once you've set up a developer account, and have a [system access token](https://docs.gusto.com/embedded-payroll/docs/system-access-tokens), you can download and use the [latest version of the API client](https://github.com/Gusto/gusto-csharp-client/tree/main/gusto_embedded#gustoembedded).
